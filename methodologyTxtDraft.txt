Methodology

We first began the work of finding our corpus. These song lyrics are taken from various websites which Steve, who was the Turkish language expert on the team, judged
to be the most accurate. We then began the process of tagging these songs for processing. We first utilized REGEX for basic structural markup, such as preserving lines,
and we used musical cues to put in stanzas and breaks. We then focused on the more complex, political ideas we wanted to tag. 


address
We tagged an "address" element whenever the narrator used called out to a "you."

ex: 

attributes: Formality, addressee

For the "formality" attribute on address, we marked "formal" for the formal "you", and "informal" for the familiar "you".

*****others here + addressee

place
We tagged any real or metaphorical place, and indicated where the words refferred to with a "where" attribute. This element may also contain references to the elements
"neglect", "poverty", "nature", another "place", "class", or "family."
ex: 

journey
We used the journey element anytime a real or metaphorical journey was refferred to. This element may also contain references to the elements "nature" or "place."

ex: 

*nature
In this element, we tagged references to the natural world. This element may also contain references to the elements "family", "place", "address", or "wealth."

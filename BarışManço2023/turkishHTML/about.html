            <h2>History of Anatolian Rock</h2>
            <p>Turkey is a somewhat young country- it was formed in 1923 after the end of World War
                II. 50 years later, Turkish rock, also know as Anatolian rock, emerges. Turkey has a
                long history of state-sanctioned music that is politically funded and trained by the
                academy belonging to the state, and Anatolian rock was one of the first mainstream
                musical movements to challenge that. In the 60’s through early 80’s, musicians were
                inspired by the export of Western rock groups like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones,
                Yes, and Led Zeppelin to Turkey. Turkish musicians took western rock and added
                traditional elements like Ashik poetry and traditional instruments, most notably the
                bağlama. Art is of course not created in a vacuum. Much as rock music in the United
                States was a rebellion against traditional sounds and often involved calls to
                revolution or cultural subversion, Turkish rock emerged as a form of rebellion to a
                very conservative state. In 1960 there a coup against the government which the
                opposition claimed was overly influenced by Islamists. A country-wide debate took
                place on the separation of religion and state. Civilian rule was restored five years
                later. By 1971, the situation between the right, capitalists and fascists, and left,
                the democrats and communists, and including many Kurds, became dire. The right had
                ascended to power through holding a majority of assembly seats and used this power
                to reorganize the government and punish political dissidents. Political violence
                erupted in the 70’s, with over 5,000 casualties from 1976-1980. </p>

            <h2>Our Project</h2>
            <p>The association of music with the state from Turkey’s inception inherently
                politicizes Turkey’s music. The Anatolian rock movement specifically captures a
                tumultuous period in Turkey’s history where there are two very distinct political
                sides, the right and the left, being expressed. We plan to analyze songs from a
                sampling of artists on both sides along with apolitical rock to determine if there
                are any differences or similarities in discourse, themes, or musical stylings
                between these groups. We selected the artists though finding the most popular
                artists online who were active in the period 1960-1980 that performed Anatolian
                rock. Once we found our artists, we chose the most political album in the period
                from that artist in order to maximize the hits of the specific tags we were looking
                for. We chose to analyze albums as a whole in order to grab content that was not
                explicitly political but surrounded the important political themes. Themes that
                could be of interest include forms of address, religion, the Kurds, poverty, love,
                economic policy, and oppression of speech and ideas. </p>

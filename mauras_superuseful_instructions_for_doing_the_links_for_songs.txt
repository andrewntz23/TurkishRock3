FOR GETTING THE LINKS IN ORDER

STEP 1 - use xquery to quickly get file names

xquery version "3.0";
let $songs := collection('/db/course/turkish/data')
return $songs/substring-after(base-uri(), 'data/')

STEP 2 - paste into text document, to use regular expressions to create links

STEP 3 - delete annoying white space

find \n
replace with \n\n

STEP 4 - REGEX-IT-UPS

find .xml
replace with nothing

find(.*)
replace with \<a href='\1.html'\>  \1\</a\>

find (\s\s.*)_
replace with nothing

find html'>(.*)-
replace with html'>\1 
run this until all dashes are removed

GOOD JOB!!!

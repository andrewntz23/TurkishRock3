Snow softly falls upon the poor.
Why they don't believe in destiny is the unaccountable saying

Burning! Burning! I am burning.
Stop it, master. What will be, what will be.
Should a man die when he is given soil
When you love your life, what will be, what will be.
You are from the mother, I am from my father.

Come, let us live together.
Supposing that I am cross with you
Burning! Burning! We are burning.
Stop it, master. What will be, what will be.
Should a man die when he is given soil
When you love your life, what will be, what will be.

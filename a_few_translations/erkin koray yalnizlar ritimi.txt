Erkin Koray - Yaln覺zlar R覺t覺m覺
Am I to be the miserable one
In the darkness of the night
Moss is clamping my eyes
In the rhythm of the lonely

I cried the whole night
In the bosom of the waves
The sea and I at night
In the rhythm of the lonely

Am I to be the forgotten one
The gulls flew away
The sea and I at night
In the rhythm of the lonely

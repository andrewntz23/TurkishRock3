            <h2>Review of Data</h2>
            <p>There are 61 songs present in the data.</p>
            <!--CHART OF SONG TOTALS-->
            <h2>Themes</h2>
            <!--Run Results For ELEMENTS BY ARTIST. We'll want a total here,
            too. Try and steal nifty auto-sort table code from other group. -->
            <p> Looking at overall thematic element counts, there are a lot of similarities between
                the artists.</p>
            <p> Love is the most commonly used theme. It is also Erkin Koray's most commonly used
                element, probably skewed by the song "Hele Yar." This comes as no suprise, due to
                the seeming universality and popularity of love songs.</p>
            <p> Nature is the second most commonly used theme. It appears extremely often in the
                works of Barış Manço and Edip Akbayram, and less commonly in those of the other
                artists.</p>
            <p>Family is one of the top themes for every artist except Erkin Koray, who does not
                make a reference to it.</p>
            <p> Death appears in each artist's songs, except for Barış Manço. It has an important
                role </p>
            <p>Friendship is also important and is a commonly used element throughtout. Dostluk is
                important in Turkish culture.</p>
            <p>Neglect appears most commonly in the songs of Selda and Cem, as well as the works of Ersen and Edip, albeit less frequently.</p>
            <p> Allah / Islam - Religious references are most common in the works of Edip, Erkin,
                and Selda. This does not appear to have any obvious relationship to their
                politics.</p>
            <p> Aşık - Ersen &amp; Barış make the most use of this element, most likely to highlight their statuses as the rock versions Turkish folk singers.</p>
            <h2>Narrators</h2>
            <p>The narrator tag was used to examine whether or not singers referred to themselves
                using singular or plural nouns or pronouns. The hypothesis was that a more overt
                political sentiment, possibly associated with leftist ideals of collectivity would
                lead the singer to use more plural nouns or pronouns to refer to themselves. Our
                results were the following:</p>
            <h3>Overall Counts</h3>
            <!--Barış Manço- TOTAL = 16, SINGULAR = 9, PLURAL = 7 Cem Karaca-
            TOTAL = 14, SINGULAR = 13, PLURAL = 1 Edip Akbayram- TOTAL = 45, SINGULAR = 40, PLURAL =
            5 Erkin Koray- TOTAL = 24, SINGULAR = 6, PLURAL = 18 Ersen- TOTAL = 38, SINGULAR = 38,
            PLURAL = 0 Selda Bağcan- TOTAL = 31, SINGULAR = 12, PLURAL = 19 --><h3>Overtly
                Leftist Songs</h3>
            <!--Cem Karaca- TOTAL = 6, SINGULAR = 6, PLURAL = 0 Selda Bağcan- TOTAL = 24,
            SINGULAR = 8, PLURAL = 16-->
            <h3>Songs Without Overt Political Sentiments</h3>
            <!--Cem Karaca-
            TOTAL = 8, SINGULAR = 7, PLURAL = 1 Selda Bağcan- TOTAL = 7, SINGULAR = 4, PLURAL = 3-->
            <p> From an examination of the data, it appears that Selda does adhere to the
                hypothesized patten. She refers to a narrator considerably more in her protet songs
                than in her non-protest songs. Additionally, her protest songs show a more frequent
                use of plural narration than singular, while her non-protest songs show no
                discernable difference.</p>
            <p> Cem Karaca, the other left-wing artist with protest songs does not follow the same
                pattern. In fact, he refers to narrators more often in non-protest songs, and uses
                singular narration considerably more than plural narration. One reason why this may
                differ is because of Cem's use of lyrics from earlier folk singers, or from poets. </p>
            <p> There are no real conclusions that can be drawn from the rest of the data.</p>
            <h2>Instrumentation</h2>
            <p>To look at the effect of artists and politics on instrumentation, we divided the
                instruments into two groups, 'traditional' and 'western.'</p>
            <!---->
            <h3>Overall Results</h3> Overall, 64 breaks contained traditional instrumentation. > 18
            solos <p>111 contained western. > 28 solos</p>
            <p>Hang on.. there's supposed to be 212 total breaks? what am I doing wrong.</p>
            <p>ANSWER: Nothing. There are 75 that are blank, or are drums (which I left out) or
                music boxes.</p>
            <!---->
            <p>If we divide the information up by song, we get the following results:</p>
            <!--Barış
            Manço -\- total: 13/ trad: 7/ west: 12 Cem Karaca -\- total: 8/ trad: 0/ west: 8 Edip

            -\- total: 10/ trad: 9/ west: 9 Selda Bağcan -\- total: 12/ trad: 7/ west: 7-->
            <p> Selda's political songs do not differ in instrumentation in any special way from her
                normal songs.</p>
            <!--Selda Bağcan (protest songs) -\- total: 5/ trad: 3/ west: 3/ both: 1 Selda
            Bağcan (non-protest songs) -\- total: 7/ trad: 4/ west: 4/ both: 1-->
            <h3>Differences in Thematic Elements Based on Instrumentation</h3>
            <p>Differences in thematic elements between songs with traditional/western information.
                (I've picked these results out of a longer xQuery)</p>

            <p> Limited data from Ersen, due to the fact that the majority of his songs contain both
                types of instrumentation. He's good at that. </p>
            <!--Selda Bağcan =

            <h3>Instruments Most Often Used By Artists</h3>
            <!--Chart-->
            <h3>Major vs Minor</h3>
            <p>Overall, the artists tended to prefer using minor scales. Although all artists
                recorded songs with both scales, only one song contains both.</p> Ersen - minor: 8,
            major: 2, both: 0 Barış Manço - minor: 10, major: 3, both: 0 Cem Karaca - minor: 4,
            major: 4, both: 0 Edip Akbayram - minor: 5, major: 5, both: 0 Erkin Koray - minor: 5,
            major: 2, both: 1 Selda Bağcan - minor: 7, major: 5, both: 0 <p> Again, there is no
                discernable difference in instrumentation between Selda and Cem's protest songs and
                non-protest songs.</p> Cem Karaca - minor: 2, major: 2, both: 0 Selda Bağcan -
            minor: 2, major: 3, both: 0 There are a few differences in overall thematic elements
            based on key, but nothing overwhelming. <p>(These are in percentages, and I accidentally
                did not save this xQuery but it won't be hard to redo in XML table form.)</p><!-- love==

            <h2>Places</h2>
            
            <p>Another element common to many of the songs is the <a href="methodology.html#place">place</a> element. The artists refer
                to a variety of places in their work, including geographical locations, the nation
                of turkey, villages, cities, the cosmos, or abstract concepts. The artists reference
                distinctly different types of places in correspondance with their political identites.</p>

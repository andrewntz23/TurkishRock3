        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p> We first began the work of finding our corpus. These song lyrics are taken from various
            websites which Steve, who was the Turkish language expert on the team, judged to be the
            most accurate. We then began the process of tagging these songs for processing. We first
            utilized REGEX for basic structural markup, such as preserving lines, and we used
            musical cues to put in stanzas and breaks. We then focused on the more complex,
            political ideas we wanted to tag. </p>
        <h3>address</h3>
        <p>We tagged an "address" element whenever the narrator used called out to a "you."For the
            "formality" attribute on address, we marked "formal" for the formal "you", and
            "informal" for the familiar "you". *****others here + addressee </p> <p>ex:&lt;address
            formality="informal" pos="verb" mood="imp"> &lt;nature>Asmadan&lt;/nature> gel
            &lt;nature>asmadan&lt;/nature> gel &lt;nature>asmadan&lt;/nature> &lt;/address> </p>
        <h3>place</h3>
        <p>We tagged any real or metaphorical place, and indicated where the words refferred to with
            a "where" attribute. This element may also contain references to the elements "neglect",
            "poverty", "nature", another "place", "class", or "family."</p>

            &lt;/place></p>
        <h3>journey</h3>
        <p>We used the journey element anytime a real or metaphorical journey was refferred to. This
